        I am a new Full Stack Web Developer out of Centriq Training who is excited to apply what he has learned in real-world scenarios and grow to become a leader in this career. I previously worked as a Clinical Laboratory Scientist at Saint Luke's on the Plaza, but decided that I wanted a career that was more product and deadline oriented. I've always had a very creative mind and my favorite part of web dev is both coming up with bold solutions in a limited framework and having a fully functional project after all of my hard work. Creating web applications and keeping up with new technology is fascinating and I'm excited to make it my new career! Outside of work I enjoy playing video games, geeking out about certain animes, writing music and jamming on my guitar with my DL-4 effects pedal, and attempting to keep up with the work that my slow metabolism creates for me (haha, the pandemic has definitely made staying fit more of a challenge than normal...). I own a very nice Montague Urban folding bicycle and my goal this summer is to be able to handle the hills in my KC neighborhood again.

        Thank you for visiting my personal site! I encourage you to check out some of the projects that I created during the Centriq course, I'm very proud of them. If you'd like to get in touch about a job opportunity, check out my Contacts page!
